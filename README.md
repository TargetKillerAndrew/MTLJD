Multi-Task Learning for Joint Diagnosis of Multiple Mental Disorders in Resting-State fMRI

# Abstract

Facing the increasing worldwide prevalence of mental disorders, the symptom-based diagnostic criteria struggle to address the urgent public health concern due to the global shortfall in well-qualified professionals. Thanks to the recent advances in neuroimaging techniques, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has surfaced as a new solution to characterize neuropathological biomarkers for detecting functional connectivity (FC) anomalies in mental disorders. However, the existing computer aided diagnosis models for fMRI analysis suffer from unstable performance on large datasets. To address this issue, we propose an efficient multi-task learning (MTL) framework for joint diagnosis of multiple mental disorders using resting-state fMRI data. A novel multi-objective evolutionary clustering algorithm is presented to group regions of interest (ROIs) into different clusters for FC pattern analysis. On the optimal clustering solution, the multi-cluster multi-gate mixture-of-expert model is used for the final classification by capturing the highly consistent feature patterns among related diagnostic tasks. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate that the performance of the proposed framework is superior to that of the other state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the potential for practical application of the framework is also validated in terms of limited computational resources, real-time analysis, and insufficient training data. The proposed model can identify the remarkable interpretative biomarkers associated with specific mental disorders for clinical interpretation analysis.
